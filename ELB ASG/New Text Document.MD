Hereâ€™s an AWS Certification Cheat Sheet based on the transcript you provided:

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances (backend).
- **Types of ELB**:
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS). Used for web traffic with features like routing, and SSL termination.
  - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Layer 4 (TCP/UDP). Handles high-performance, millions of requests per second, and provides static IPs.
  - **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**: Layer 3. Routes traffic to third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection).
  - **Classic Load Balancer**: Being retired (not needed for the exam).
- **Health Checks**: Automatically directs traffic only to healthy EC2 instances.

### Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- **Scaling Strategies**:
  - **Manual Scaling**: User adjusts instance count.
  - **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts instance count based on demand (CloudWatch Alarms).
    - **Step Scaling**: Adds/removes capacity based on specific thresholds.
    - **Target Tracking Scaling**: Maintains specific utilization targets (e.g., CPU at 40%).
  - **Scheduled Scaling**: Adjusts capacity based on known patterns (e.g., specific times).
  - **Predictive Scaling**: Uses machine learning to predict traffic and adjust capacity accordingly.
- **Integration with ELB**: Instances created by ASG are automatically registered to target groups and health-checked by the ELB.

### Key Concepts
- **High Availability (HA)**: Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZ) to ensure resilience.
- **Scalability**:
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing instance size.
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Increasing the number of instances.
- **Elasticity**: Scaling resources up or down automatically based on demand.
- **Agility**: The speed at which resources can be provisioned and deprovisioned in the cloud.

This summary covers the essential topics of ELB, ASG, and scaling for AWS certifications.
