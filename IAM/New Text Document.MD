### AWS IAM Cheat Sheet

#### **Overview**
- **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) is a global service, not tied to any specific region.
- It helps in securely controlling access to AWS resources.

#### **Root User**
- **Root account**: The account that has full administrative privileges and should be used only for initial setup.
- **Best practice**: Avoid using the root account for day-to-day activities. Instead, create IAM users with the necessary permissions.

#### **IAM Users**
- **IAM Users**: Represent individual users within your AWS account.
- **Use case**: Create an IAM user for each person or application needing access.
- **Permissions**: Assign permissions to users through **policies**.

#### **IAM Groups**
- **Groups**: Collections of IAM users.
- **Benefits**: Apply permissions to multiple users by attaching policies to groups.
- **Example**: Create an "Admin" group with **AdministratorAccess** policy to manage permissions for all admins at once.

#### **IAM Roles**
- **Roles**: Used to delegate permissions to AWS services. this is just like user but for aws services
- **Use case**: Assign roles to services like EC2, Lambda, etc., to manage their permissions without sharing credentials.
- **Cross-Account Access**: Roles can also be assumed by entities in different AWS accounts.

#### **Policies**
- **Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions (allow/deny actions on resources).
- **Components**:
  - **Effect**: Either `Allow` or `Deny`.
  - **Action**: List of actions (like `s3:ListBucket`) that are permitted or denied.
  - **Resource**: The AWS resources the actions apply to.
  - **Condition**: Optional conditions under which the policy is applied.
  
#### **Best Practices for IAM**
1. **Least Privilege Principle**: Give users the minimal permissions they need.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA for an extra layer of security.
3. **Use Groups**: Manage permissions by grouping users.
4. **Use Roles**: Prefer roles over access keys for granting services permissions.
5. **Password Policies**: Set strong password requirements (e.g., length, expiration).

#### **Access Keys**
- **Access Keys**: Required for programmatic access via the CLI or SDK.
- **Important**: Treat access keys like passwordsâ€”do not share them.
- **CLI/SDK Setup**: Use `aws configure` to set up access keys and configure AWS CLI.

#### **Credential Reports**
- **Credential Report**: CSV report that details the security status of IAM users, including password policies, MFA usage, and access keys.
- **Use Case**: Helps audit security and identify inactive users or outdated credentials.

#### **IAM Access Advisor**
- **Access Advisor**: Provides data on the services accessed by a user and helps fine-tune permissions.
  
#### **IAM Policy Example**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **CLI & SDK**
- **CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface is a powerful tool for managing AWS resources from your terminal.
- **SDK**: Software Development Kits allow you to interact with AWS services programmatically in different languages (e.g., Python's boto3).

#### **Managing IAM with CLI**
- **List users**: `aws iam list-users`
- **Create user**: `aws iam create-user --user-name Username`
- **Attach policy to user**: `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name Username --policy-arn PolicyARN`
