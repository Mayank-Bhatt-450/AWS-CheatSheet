### **Amazon S3 Overview**
- **Main Features**: 
  - Infinitely scalable storage, often used for websites, backups, disaster recovery, big data analytics, and hosting static websites.
  - S3 is used for data lakes, archival storage (e.g., **S3 Glacier** for long-term storage), and hosting applications/media.
  - **Bucket** = top-level directory, **Objects** = files stored in buckets.
  - Buckets must have **globally unique names**, tied to specific regions.
  
### **Object Structure**
- **Key**: Full path of an object (includes prefix + object name).
- Max size for an object is **5TB**. If greater than 5GB, use **multi-part upload**.
- Objects can have **metadata**, **tags**, and **version IDs** if versioning is enabled.

### **Security in S3**
- **User-Based**: Control access through **IAM policies**.
- **Resource-Based**: Use **S3 Bucket Policies** for cross-account access or to make a bucket public.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Finer-grained control for objects and buckets (rarely used now).
- **Encryption**: 
  - **Server-side encryption**: Handled by S3, data is encrypted when it arrives.
  - **Client-side encryption**: Data is encrypted by the user before uploading.
  - **Bucket Policies**: Can enforce public access, force encryption at upload, or allow cross-account access.
  
### **Hosting Static Websites**
- **S3 Static Website Hosting**: Enable a bucket for static website hosting. Specify an **index.html** as the home page. Attach a bucket policy for public access.
- **Website URL**: Depends on the AWS region and bucket configuration.

### **Versioning**
- Enable at the **bucket level** to protect against unintended deletes and rollbacks.
- **Previous versions** are kept and can be restored.
- **Versioning Notes**: Objects uploaded before versioning are marked with **null version IDs**. Deleting a file adds a **delete marker**.

### **Replication**
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Copies data across different AWS regions.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**: Copies data within the same region.
- **Use Cases**: Compliance, low-latency access, log aggregation, and disaster recovery.

### **S3 Storage Classes**
1. **S3 Standard**: General-purpose, frequently accessed data. 99.99% availability.
2. **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)**: For data accessed less often, but requires rapid access when needed.
3. **S3 One Zone-IA**: Infrequently accessed data in one AZ (availability zone).
4. **Glacier Storage**:
   - **Instant Retrieval**: Milliseconds retrieval time.
   - **Flexible Retrieval**: Expedited (1-5 mins), Standard (3-5 hrs), Bulk (5-12 hrs).
   - **Deep Archive**: Cheapest option, but retrieval can take up to 48 hours.
5. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatically moves objects between tiers based on usage patterns.

### **Lifecycle Rules**
- Automate object transitions between storage classes.
- Example: Move to **IA** after 30 days, move to **Glacier** after 180 days.

### **Snow Family**
- **Snowcone**, **Snowball Edge**, **Snowmobile**: Physical devices to move data in and out of AWS S3.
  - **Snowball Edge**: Provides compute capabilities (e.g., edge computing).
  - **Snowmobile**: Large-scale data migrations.
  - **OpsHub**: A desktop application to manage Snow Family devices.

### **S3 Exam Tips**
- Know the difference between **Buckets** (globally unique) and **Objects**.
- Familiarize yourself with **S3 Security**: IAM Policies, Bucket Policies, ACLs, and encryption methods.
- Be aware of different **S3 storage classes** and **use cases**.
- Understand how **Versioning** and **Replication** work in S3.
- Lifecycle rules for transitioning data between different storage classes.
- **Snow Family** is used for large-scale data migrations into S3.
